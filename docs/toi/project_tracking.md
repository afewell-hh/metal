# Project Tracking

## Active Development (Last Updated: 2025-01-25)

### Current Sprint
We are implementing the port assignment and validation logic with a focus on proper handling of breakout configurations.

#### In Progress
1. **Port Assignment Logic Enhancement**
   - Implementing breakout configuration support in `portAssignmentManager.js`
   - Adding port speed determination from switch profiles
   - Enhancing validation rules for fabric design
   - Status: Core logic implemented, working on breakout support
   - Next steps: 
     - Complete breakout configuration handling
     - Add unit tests for port assignment logic
     - Integrate with configuration generator

2. **Configuration Generation**
   - Updating output format to support breakout ports
   - Enhancing validation checks
   - Status: Basic structure in place, needs breakout support
   - Blocked by: Completion of breakout configuration handling

#### Recently Completed
1. **Switch Profile Management**
   - Implemented Go profile parsing
   - Added profile inheritance support
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Added initialization checks

2. **Port Allocation Rules**
   - Implemented YAML-based rule definition
   - Added support for overlapping port ranges
   - Enhanced validation against profiles

#### Immediate Next Tasks
1. Complete breakout configuration support
2. Add unit tests for port assignment
3. Update configuration generator
4. Add integration tests

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term (Next 2-3 Sprints)
1. **Enhanced Validation**
   - Add comprehensive fabric design validation
   - Implement port capacity checks
   - Add breakout compatibility validation
   - Rationale: Critical for preventing configuration errors

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Enhance error messages
   - Add error recovery suggestions
   - Implement proper async error handling
   - Rationale: Better user experience and debugging

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Add comprehensive test suite
   - Implement integration tests
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Rationale: Ensure reliability and maintainability

### Medium-term (Next 2-3 Months)
1. **Configuration Preview**
   - Add visual topology preview
   - Show port assignments graphically
   - Provide configuration diff view
   - Rationale: Help users understand generated configurations

2. **Profile Management UI**
   - Add UI for viewing switch profiles
   - Allow profile customization
   - Provide profile comparison
   - Rationale: Easier profile management

3. **Validation Enhancement**
   - Add real-time validation
   - Provide suggested fixes
   - Support custom validation rules
   - Rationale: Prevent errors earlier in the process

### Long-term Vision
1. **Advanced Features**
   - Support for complex topology patterns
   - Custom port allocation strategies
   - Integration with network simulation
   - Rationale: Support more advanced use cases

2. **Automation**
   - CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Automated testing
   - Configuration deployment
   - Rationale: Streamline deployment process

3. **Platform Evolution**
   - Support for additional switch types
   - Custom profile creation
   - Third-party integrations
   - Rationale: Broader platform support

## Design Considerations

### Current Implementation Impact on Future Features
1. **Port Assignment**
   - Current design separates port validation from assignment
   - Allows future addition of custom assignment strategies
   - Breakout support being added with future expansion in mind

2. **Configuration Generation**
   - Output format designed for future extensions
   - Modular approach allows adding new features
   - Validation framework can be extended

3. **Profile Management**
   - Inheritance system supports future profile types
   - Extensible validation framework
   - Prepared for UI integration

## Technical Debt Tracking

### Current Technical Debt
1. **Error Handling**
   - Some error messages need improvement
   - Async error handling needs work
   - Priority: Medium

2. **Testing**
   - Missing unit tests for new features
   - Need integration tests
   - Priority: High

3. **Documentation**
   - Some complex logic needs better documentation
   - API documentation incomplete
   - Priority: Medium

### Planned Refactoring
1. **Port Assignment Logic**
   - Extract breakout handling to separate class
   - Improve validation organization
   - Timeline: After current sprint

2. **Configuration Generator**
   - Modularize output generation
   - Add plugin system for extensions
   - Timeline: Medium-term

## Notes and Decisions
- Decided to prioritize breakout support before adding more validation
- Keeping configuration format extensible for future needs
- Planning to add visual topology preview after core features
- Need to consider performance implications of real-time validation

## Session Continuity
Last session ended while implementing port assignment logic. To continue:
1. Review `portAssignmentManager.js` implementation
2. Complete breakout configuration support
3. Add unit tests for new functionality
4. Update configuration generator to use new features
