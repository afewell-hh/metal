# Current Implementation State

## Completed Features
1. Basic frontend structure
   - React components for form input
   - Configuration generation framework
   - Switch profile management

2. Profile Management
   - Go profile parsing
   - PAR rule loading
   - Profile inheritance handling

3. Port Rules
   - YAML-based port rule definition
   - Basic port validation
   - Support for overlapping port ranges

## In Progress
1. Port Assignment Logic
   - Need to implement breakout handling
   - Need to add port capacity validation
   - Need to implement port distribution algorithm

2. Configuration Generation
   - Basic structure in place
   - Need to enhance with breakout support
   - Need to add comprehensive validation

## Known Issues
1. Profile Loading
   - Currently requires specific file structure
   - Error handling needs improvement
   - Need better feedback for missing files

2. Validation
   - Basic port validation only
   - Need to add fabric design validation
   - Need to add capacity checks

## Next Steps
1. Implement comprehensive port assignment logic
2. Add breakout configuration support
3. Enhance validation rules
4. Improve error handling and user feedback
5. Add unit tests for core functionality

## Recent Changes
1. Updated SwitchProfileManager to handle Go profiles
2. Added proper initialization checks
3. Improved error handling in profile loading
4. Updated Vite config for proper file serving

## Critical Considerations
1. Memory Management
   - Keep TOI documents updated
   - Make frequent git commits
   - Document complex logic inline

2. Code Organization
   - Maintain clear separation of concerns
   - Document file relationships
   - Keep configuration predictable

3. Testing
   - Need comprehensive test suite
   - Focus on edge cases
   - Validate all port scenarios
